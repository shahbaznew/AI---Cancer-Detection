# AI---Cancer-Detection

This projects conisists of building an AI model designed to read a dataset and test and train itself on the per-existing data to deliver the correct results. 
The projects utlises pandas, Tensorflow, Keras to train the model baseed on the data recieved. Additonally using sklearn.model and importing the train_test_split it allows the AI train, test itself on the information provided. 
As shown in the project a neural network was created using Dense provide the size of network and the activation. Lastly the model tracks the loss and accuracy of the information with a total accuracy number shown.
