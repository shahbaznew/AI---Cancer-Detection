# AI---Cancer-Detection

This projects conisists of building an AI model designed to read a dataset and test and train itself on the pre-existing data to deliver the correct results. 
The projects utlises pandas, Tensorflow, Keras to train the model based on the data recieved. Additonally using sklearn.model and importing the train_test_split it allows the AI train, test itself on the information provided. I used a 0.2 split between the split as good practise to allow the AI to use some the dataset to train.  
As shown in the project a neural network was created using Dense providing the size of network and the activation. Lastly the model tracks the loss and accuracy of the information with a total accuracy number shown.
